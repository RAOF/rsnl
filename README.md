# RSNL

This is the beginning of a library for netlink and libnl-3.

The plan is to structure it out similar to libnl (core, route, genl, nf), but appropiately abstracted in ways that make it geared more toward being a rust interface.

I'm not doing mass bind generation because I'm going to methodically work through the API to craft the library.


#### License

Out of respect to Libnl, the library is licensed under LGPL


### Notes

Please note this project is also a base for me to learn the actual language, so it will probably start out flakey while I get my feet.
